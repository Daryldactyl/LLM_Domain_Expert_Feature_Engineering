# LLM_Domain_Expert_Feature_Engineering
Trained a RAG Agent on Biological research papers to take in protein sequences and output an additional 35 columns of features derived from protein sequences. This project is mostly a proof of concept as to be cost effective, I only ran the model on 100 rows of the 30,000 row dataset.
